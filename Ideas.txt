GodLike's Idea : Putting cities mods inside the mappack connected with the mountains. 

Erling's idea : Maybe try to retexture 60 - 100 % off all maps, i have done Project T and new iroha and meihan so far :)

SHHADA's idea : If possible, try to remodel some of the maps. Like making the cones and security barrier as movable objects so we can knock m over instead of only bump into them.

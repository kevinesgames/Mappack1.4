Meihan Fixes
- scrape wall: road as bugs, can drop a wheel in it
- long drift corner: make excessive back texture feel like riding on traintracks
- tree textures: need to be 2sided (only got half trees now)
- road: gives tree and scratch textures edges and makes u see through them


Kanagawa Fixes
- railing above wall texture: need fix / inspection
- need to add couple of roadsigns, barriers, cones etc for roads that lead to nothing
- optional: add buildings / something else. something creative to really finish the map.
